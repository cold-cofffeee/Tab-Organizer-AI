## Quick Setup

To add your icons:

1. Create or download icon files in the required sizes
2. Name them exactly as listed above
3. Place them in this `icons/` directory
4. Reload the extension in Chrome to see the new icons

The extension will work without custom icons (Chrome will use defaults), but custom icons provide a professional appearance and better brand recognition.
